# RollbetAutoFreeCaseBattle
Script to automatically join Free Battles on rollbet.gg

There is 2 ways for manual use, bookmark(faster) and console, but i will only cover the bookmark way as it is easyer and better,
automatic mode is not finished yet but will be implemented in the very near future

<details>
<summary>Steps for manual use (need to be runned again on every page refresh)</summary>
  
# You just need to crate a bookmark, set the name to something like "autoFreeBattle" (your choice, it doesnt matter)
# and then set the URL of the bookmark you created to a code here below.

# make sure to copy all or it wont work
```
eval(eval(await(await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itaplyr/RollbetAutoFreeCaseBattle/refs/heads/main/script')).text()))
