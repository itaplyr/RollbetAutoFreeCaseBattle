# RollbetAutoFreeCaseBattle
Script to automatically join Free Battles on rollbet.gg

<details>
<summary># Steps for manual use (need to be runned again on every page refresh)</summary>

There is 2 ways for manual use, bookmark(faster) and console, but i will only cover the bookmark part

You just need to crate a bookmark, set the name to something like "autoFreeBattle" (your choice, it doesnt matter)
and then set the URL of the bookmark you created to a code here below.

# make sure to copy all or it wont work
```
eval(eval(await(await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itaplyr/RollbetAutoFreeCaseBattle/refs/heads/main/script')).text()))
```
